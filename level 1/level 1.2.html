        <p>A stone axe among others
            Quiet on the far side of the glass</p>
        <p>The constellations rotate,
            Many of us perish,
            Many of us generated,
            Over and over comets narrowly avoid collision,
            Many dishes are&nbsp;&nbsp; s&nbsp;m&nbsp;a&nbsp;s&nbsp;h&nbsp;e&nbsp;d,<br>
            Eskimo dogs walk on the South Pole,
            Great tombs are raised, east and west,
            Shivering under the small lamp light
            Collections of poems are dedicated,
            And quite recently,
            They split an atom,
            Shivering under the small lamp light
            And a president's daughter sang a song . . .ðŸŽµ
            Various things have even happened
            Since then.</p>
        <p>A stone axe among others
            Lies quiet on the far side of the glass</p>
