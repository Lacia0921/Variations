        <p2>The constellations rotate,<br>
            Many of us perish,<br>
            Many of us generated,<br>
            Over and over comets narrowly avoid collision,<br>
            Many dishes are smashed,<br>
            Eskimo dogs walk on the South Pole,<br>
            Great tombs are raised, east and west,<br>
            Shivering under the small lamp light<br>
            Collections of poems are dedicated,<br>
            And quite recently,<br>
            They split an atom,<br>
            Shivering under the small lamp light<br>
            And a president's daughter sang a song . . .<br>
            Various things have even happened<br>
            Since then.<br></p2>
