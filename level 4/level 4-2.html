        <p>A stone axe among others,
            Quiet on the far side of the glass.</p>
        <p><span>T</span>he constellations rotate,
            Many of us perish,
            Many of us generated,
            Over and over comets narrowly avoid collision,
            Many dishes are smashed,
            Eskimo dogs walk on the South Pole,
            Great tombs are raised, east and west,
            Shivering under the small lamp light
            Collections of poems are dedicated,
            And quite recently,
            They split an atom,
            Shivering under the small lamp light,
            And a president's daughter sang a song...
            Various things have even happened,
            Since then.</p>
        <p>A stone axe among others,
            Lies quiet on the far side of the glass.</p>
