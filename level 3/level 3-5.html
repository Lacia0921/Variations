        <p>A stone axe among others<br>
            Quiet on the far side of the glass</p>

            <span3>
        <p>The constellations rotate,<br>
            Many of us perish,<br>
            Many of us generated,<br>
            Over and over comets narrowly avoid collision,<br>
            </span3>
            <span4>
            Many dishes are smashed,<br>
            Eskimo dogs walk on the South Pole,<br>
            Great tombs are raised, east and west,<br>
            Shivering under the small lamp light<br>
            </span4>
            <span5>
            Collections of poems are dedicated,<br>
            And quite recently,<br>
            They split an atom,<br>
            Shivering under the small lamp light<br>
            </span5>
            <span6>
            And a president's daughter sang a song . . .<br>
            Various things have even happened<br>
            Since then.</p>
        <p>A stone axe among others<br>
            Lies quiet on the far side of the glass</p>
